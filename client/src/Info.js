      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>#5ALIVE began back in 1879 in a small village in Russia. All records were kept on elk hides and then burned ceremonially at the end of the season, a tradition that we continue today.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2>RULES</h2>
      <p>The rules are simple, yet pleasing to the eye - participants select five teams that collectively won no more than 100 games the previous season. The person whose teams win the most games this year wins the grand prize: a Fast & The Furious DVD box set and a 6-pack of Doritos-flavored Mountain Dew.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2>2018-19</h2>
      <p>This season promises to be our greatest yet, with the following #5ALIVE legends already confirming their commitment:
          <br></br>
